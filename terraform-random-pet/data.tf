# Purpose:
# The data.tf file contains Terraform data sourcesâ€”these do not create resources but query existing infrastructure or configuration for reference.

# Best Practices:
# - Data source declarations: Place all data blocks here, for example, data "aws_ami" "linux" { ... }.
# - Clear naming and purpose: Use descriptive names for data sources to indicate their role (e.g., data "aws_ami" "ubuntu_latest").
# - Commenting and filtering: Document why each data source is used and ensure filters or queries are well explained.
# - Minimize external dependencies: Only query the minimum necessary information. Overly complicated data sources can slow down Terraform runs and confuse future maintainers.
