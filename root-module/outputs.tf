# Purpose:
# The outputs.tf file defines values that the module exports for use by the caller.

# Best Practices:
# - Descriptive output names: Use meaningful names (e.g., instance_id, db_connection_string).
# - Descriptions: Include description attributes to clarify the purpose of each output.
# - Minimal outputs: Only output what consumers need. For sensitive outputs, mark as `sensitive = true`.
